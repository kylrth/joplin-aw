# JoplinAW

This is a plugin for importing your ActivityWatch logs into a Joplin note in a readable format.

The inspiration for creating this plugin was seeing someone's [meticulous log of how they spent all their time](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/10jjvg0/how_i_spent_every_minute_of_my_phd/) during their PhD.

You can install this plugin in Joplin by going to `Tools -> Options`, clicking Plugins, and searching for JoplinAW.

## usage

Once the plugin is added to Joplin, you can find the `getAWLogs` command in the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`), or find the menu option `Tools -> Insert ActivityWatch logs`. The command writes the information where your cursor is.

The command accepts an optional argument to choose the day to get information for, either by specifying a day offset ("-1" for yesterday, etc.) or a date ("2023-12-25").

Running the `getAWLogs` command pastes a summary of app usage for every 15 minute period in which the user was active during the specified day. Here's an example of what that might look like:
